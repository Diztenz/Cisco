Different physical media support the transfer of bits at different speeds. The rate of data transfer is usually discussed in terms of bandwidth and throughput.

Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data. Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that (theoretically) can be sent across the media in a second. Common bandwidth measurements are as follows:

-   Thousands of bits per second (kbps)
-   Millions of bits per second (Mbps)
-   Billions of bits per second (Gbps)

Physical media properties, current technologies, and the laws of physics all play a role in determining available bandwidth.

Equivalence

Bits per second

bps

1 bps = fundamental unit of bandwidth

Kilobyte = Thousands of bits per second

kbps

1 kbps = 1,000 bps = 103 bps

Megabyte = Millions of bits per second

Mbps

1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bps = 106 bps

Gigabyte = Billions of bits per second

Gbps

1 Gbps = 1,000,000,000 bps = 109 bps

Terabyte = Trillions of bits per second

Tbps

1 Tbps = 1,000,000,000,000 bps = 1012 bps

Throughput is any amount of data that is sent and received over a connection including delays on the connection.

Like bandwidth, throughput is the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time. However, due to a number of factors, throughput does not usually match the specified bandwidth.

Many factors influence throughput including:

-   The amount of data being sent and received over the connection
-   The types of data being transmitted
-   The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination

Latency refers to the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.

In an internetwork or network with multiple segments, throughput cannot be faster than the slowest link of the path from sending device to the receiving device.

Review:
* 1.  Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data.
2.  The amount of data, type of data, and latency of the network combine to cause throughput to not match bandwidth.
3.  Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that can be sent across the media in a second.
