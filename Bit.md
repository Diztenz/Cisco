The Bit
* abbreviation of binary digit.
* A bit is stored and transmitted as one of two possible discrete states.  This can include two directions of magnetization, two distinct voltage or current levels, two distinct levels of light intensity, or any other physical system of two discrete states.

Every input device (mouse, keyboard, voice-activated receiver) will translate human interaction into binary code for the CPU to process and store. Every output device (printer, speakers, monitors, etc.) will take binary data and translate it back into human recognizable form. Within the computer itself, all data is processed and stored as binary.

Computers use binary codes to represent and interpret letters, numbers and special characters with bits. A commonly used code is the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). With ASCII, each character is represented by eight bits. For example:

-   **Capital letter**: A = 01000001
-   **Number**: 9 = 00111001
-   **Special character**: # = 00100011

Each group of eight bits, such as the representations of letters and numbers, is known as a byte.

ASCII =  American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
